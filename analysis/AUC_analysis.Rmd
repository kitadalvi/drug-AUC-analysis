#Filtering and normalisation
First, we need to filter out genes with low read counts, and calculate normalization factors for each sample:
```{r}
#filtering to remove low counts
keep <- filterByExpr(y, design = design)
table(keep)
y <- y[keep, , keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]

#normalizing library sizes
y <- calcNormFactors(y)

#fit GLMs
y <- estimateDisp(y, design, robust=TRUE)
fit <- glmFit(y, design)
```
